House Prices Data Analysis & Inference

This project explores a housing market dataset to understand how factors like size, year built, and location influence house prices.
It includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and a simple inferential test to check assumptions about average pricing.

This is my Second Semester Data Science Project, and it demonstrates my ability to work with real datasets, clean them, analyze them, and communicate insights clearly.

1 — Overview

The goal of this project was to analyze a sample of housing market data and uncover meaningful insights that could help buyers, sellers, or analysts understand what drives house prices.

The analysis was performed in Python using a Jupyter Notebook and covers:

Data loading & inspection

Handling missing values and outliers

Feature engineering

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

NumPy operations

A basic inferential test

Clear explanations of every step

2 — Key Insights From the Data
🏠 House Prices Distribution

Prices were right-skewed, meaning a few very expensive houses raise the overall average.

The median price was a more stable measure than the mean.

📏 Living Area vs Sale Price

There was a strong positive correlation between living area (sq ft) and sale price.

Larger homes consistently sold for more, with some exceptions based on location.

💡 Price Per Square Foot

Creating the price per sq ft feature exposed interesting differences:

Some smaller homes had a higher price per sq ft, suggesting location and renovation can influence value more than size.

📉 Outliers

A few extremely large or extremely expensive houses were distorting the analysis.

Removing or adjusting them produced cleaner visualizations and more reliable trends.

📊 Inferential Statistics

Using a one-sample t-test, I tested whether the average house price exceeds $180,000.

The test result showed statistically significant evidence that the average price is above $180,000.
